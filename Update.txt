It is categorised in 4 steps:

1)Device Update Agent Provisioning

1.1)Prerequisites
If you're setting up the IoT device/IoT Edge device for package based updates, add packages.microsoft.com to your machine’s repositories by following these steps:

a)Log onto the machine or IoT device on which you intend to install the Device Update agent.
b)Open a Terminal window.
c)Install the repository configuration that matches your device’s operating system.
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/multiarch/prod.list > ./microsoft-prod.list
d)Copy the generated list to the sources.list.d directory.
sudo cp ./microsoft-prod.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
e)Install the Microsoft GPG public key.
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg
sudo cp ./microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/

1.2)How to provision the Device Update agent as a Module Identity:
a)On IoT Edge enabled devices:
-Install and provision the Azure IoT Edge runtime.
-Install the Device Update image update agent.
-Install the Device Update package update agent.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install deviceupdate-agent deliveryoptimization-plugin-apt
-You are now ready to start the Device Update agent on your IoT Edge device.

1.3)How to start the Device Update Agent:
-Log into the machine or device that has the Device Update agent installed.
-Open a Terminal window, and enter the command below.
sudo systemctl restart adu-agent
-You can check the status of the agent using the command below. 
sudo systemctl status adu-agent
-You should see status OK.
-On the IoT Hub portal, go to IoT device or IoT Edge devices to find the device that you configured with Device Update agent. There you will see the Device Update agent running as a module. 

2)Add an update to Device Update for IoT Hub
2.1)Prerequisites
-Access to an IoT Hub with Device Update for IoT Hub enabled.
-An IoT device (or simulator) provisioned for Device Update within IoT Hub.
-PowerShell 5 or later (includes Linux, macOS and Windows installs)
-Supported browsers:
 Microsoft Edge
 Google Chrome

2.2)Create a Device Update import manifest
-Ensure that your update file(s) are located in a directory accessible from PowerShell.
-Create a text file named AduUpdate.psm1 in the directory where your update image file or APT Manifest file is located. Then open the AduUpdate.psm1 PowerShell cmdlet, copy the contents to your text file, and then save the text file.
-In PowerShell, navigate to the directory where you created your PowerShell cmdlet from step 2. Use the Copy option below and then paste into PowerShell to run the commands:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
Import-Module .\AduUpdate.psm1
-Run the following commands by replacing the sample parameter values to generate an import manifest, a JSON file that describes the update:
$compat = New-AduUpdateCompatibility -DeviceManufacturer 'deviceManufacturer' -DeviceModel 'deviceModel'

$importManifest = New-AduImportManifest -Provider 'updateProvider' -Name 'updateName' -Version 'updateVersion' `
                                        -UpdateType 'updateType' -InstalledCriteria 'installedCriteria' `
                                        -Compatibility $compat -Files 'updateFilePath(s)'

$importManifest | Out-File '.\importManifest.json' -Encoding UTF8
-Review the generated import manifest

2.3)Import an update
-Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to your IoT Hub with Device Update.
-On the left-hand side of the page, select "Device Updates" under "Automatic Device Management".
-Across the top of the screen. Select the Updates tab.
-Select "+ Import New Update" below the "Ready to Deploy" header.
-Select the folder icon or text box under "Select an Import Manifest File". You will see a file picker dialog. Select the Import Manifest you created previously using the PowerShell cmdlet. Next, select the folder icon or text box under "Select one or more update files". You will see a file picker dialog. Select your update file(s).
-Select the folder icon or text box under "Select a storage container". Then select the appropriate storage account. The storage container is used to stage the update files temporarily.
-If you’ve already created a container, you can reuse it. (Otherwise, select "+ Container" to create a new storage container for updates.). Select the container you wish to use and click "Select".
-Select "Submit" to start the import process.
-The import process begins, and the screen switches to to the "Import History" section. Select "Refresh" to view progress until the import process completes (depending on the size of the update, this may complete in a few minutes but could take longer).
-When the Status column indicates the import has succeeded, select the "Ready to Deploy" header. You should see your imported update in the list now.

3)Create device groups in Device Update for IoT Hub
3.1)Prerequisites
-Access to an IoT Hub with Device Update for IoT Hub enabled. It is recommended that you use a S1 (Standard) tier or above for your IoT Hub.
-An IoT device (or simulator) provisioned for Device Update within IoT Hub.
-At least one update has been successfully imported for the provisioned device.

3.2)Add a tag to your devices
-Device Update for IoT Hub allows deploying an update to a group of IoT devices. To create a group, the first step is to add a tag to the target set of devices in IoT Hub. Tags can only be successfully added to your device after it has been connected to Device Update.
-Direct Twin Updates
--Tags can also be added or updated in device twin directly.
--Log into Azure portal and navigate to your IoT Hub.
--From 'IoT Devices' or 'IoT Edge' on the left navigation pane find your IoT device and navigate to the Device Twin.
--In the Device Twin, delete any existing Device Update tag value by setting them to null.
