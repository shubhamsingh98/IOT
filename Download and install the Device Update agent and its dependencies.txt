Create a device update instance
An instance of Device Update is associated with a single IoT hub. Select the IoT hub that will be used with Device Update. We will create a new Shared Access policy during this step to ensure Device Update uses only the required permissions to work with IoT Hub (registry write and service connect). This policy ensures that access is only limited to Device Update.
